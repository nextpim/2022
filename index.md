## About the Workshop

Over the past decade or so, Processing in Memory (PIM) has evolved from single-cell demonstrations to large scale commercial deployment by leading processor and memory vendors. This workshop recognizes the pervasiveness of PIM across several application domains that form the backbone of computing systems today. It seeks to identify the successes, failures, and future opportunities for this technology as well as potentially new applications that will dictate the ongoing research and development in this field.  Additionally, the workshop will address the tool chain and runtimes to support the PIM deployment.

## Call for Papers

Possible topics of interest include, but not limited to

1. Current and future application domains being impacted by PIM. Examples include:
  - Several works in AI inferencing based on emerging memory technologies
  - Security: Homomorphic encryption using in-memory computing
  - Graph applications: Dense/sparse graph traversals, GCNs using PIM
2. Overview of key real world PIM deployments
  - Journey from device to system
  - Key hardware and software innovations 
  - Challenges in design, manufacture, and large-scale adoption
3. Enhancements in programming methodologies
  - Compilers, runtime, libraries enabling PIM
  - Integration of PIM in existing software programming paradigms
  - Domain-specific languages for optimizing PIM-based architectures
4. Modeling performance, energy, reliability
  - Useful tools and methodologies
  - Measurement-based validation
5. Future of PIM
  - Reconfigurable conventional/PIM processors
  - New computing paradigms (eg. stochastic computing, sparse/high-dimensional computing) facilitated by PIM
  - Impact of new industry-standard coherent interconnect protocols like CXL/CCIX on the adoption and implementation of PIM

Papers on research in flight with experimental verification in progress are welcome.
